        <p>I am a master's student in Computer Science and also a 4th year Ph.D candidate in Chemical Engineering at the University of Southern California. My research interesets is developing computational methods to screen a large amount of molecules for high performance catalysts, which are molecules closely related to daily life, from gasoline production to plastic waste decomposition. </p>
          
        <p>In the meantime of devoting myself to research, I had a chance to do interdisciplinary project that built machine learning models like random forest to predict chemical properties for 130,000 molecules. The results of machine learning is suprisingly as great as DFT calculations, which is accurate and proved convincing in the field of chemistry. This experience motivates me for obtaining more programming skills and joining in a master's program in computer science. </p>
        
        <p>Since then I have developed a strong expertise in programming â€” I have been a teaching assistant for two USC engineering courses, where I taught graduate students with writing Python programs to study the process of heat transmission in materials. I am also proficient in programming with Java, C, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, MySQL, C++, familiar with libraries and technologies like PyTorch, scikit-learn, Node.JS, React.JS and have experiences working with cloud servers like Google APP Engine and Amazon Web Services.
          </p>
          
        <p>After conducting several projects about NLP, web and operating system, etc, I developed interests in Web and APP development. Also, I am willing to apply my research skills, acquiring from Ph.D projects to conduct more research in field of data mining, data management, machine learning, natural language understanding, etc. Now I am seeking for a software engineering/research internship position for summer 2021.</p>
